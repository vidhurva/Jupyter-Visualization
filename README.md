# Jupyter-Visualization
A series of projects conveying the different types of visualizations on Jupyter with Notebook Widgets

Introduction
---

I'm back on the Python life, and I'll be developing new projects and projects innovated from tutorials on Jupyter! In particular, I will be practicing Juptyer's interactive widgets, which allows me to visualize data and graphs. Additionally, I will be attaching my codes and images resulting from the code.

Project 1 - The Magic of Maps:
---

This project demonstrates Geospatial analytics. Geospatial analytics allows us to use geographic coordinates to indentify a specific address or a general area of the map. The image is then produced from satellite photography. For this process to occur, first install ipyleaflet from terminal (or an equivalent to terminal depending on your computer) and then apply ipyleaflet to obtain your satellite photo. The coordinates that I implemented in this map is Hell's kitchen, NYC. 

Project 1 - Installation: 
-----
Using conda on terminal: 
```
conda install -c conda-forge ipyleaflet
```

Project 2 - An Epic Scatter Plot:
