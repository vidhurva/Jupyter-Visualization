# Jupyter-Visualization
A series of projects conveying the different types of visualizations on Jupyter with Notebook Widgets

// Summary 

I'm back on the Python life, and I'll be developing new projects and projects innovated from tutorials on Jupyter! In particular, I will be practicing Juptyer's interactive widgets, which allows me to visualize data and graphs. Additionally, I will be attaching my codes and images resulting from the code.
